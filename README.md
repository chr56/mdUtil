# What's This?

This was a part of [app-theme-helper](https://github.com/kabouzeid/app-theme-helper). 
I reorganized and refactor these codes, this is the part for activity and widget coloring.

This is used for [Phonograph Plus](https://github.com/chr56/Phonograph_Plus).





# Original README digest
# App Theme Helper

This is basically a copy of [App Theme Engine](https://github.com/afollestad/app-theme-engine) by [Aidan Follestad](https://github.com/afollestad) which only includes the "Config" part. This library is only for saving and querying theme values. The user is responsible to use those values (applying to Views), unlike ATE this library won't automatically theme your views. As an extra this library includes a few Util methods from ATE and myself to make theming easy.
